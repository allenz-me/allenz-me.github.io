This paper considers a classic multilocation newsvendor setting following Eppen (1979), where the demand distribution is heavy tailed rather than normally distributed.

Heavy-tail distributions refer to those whose tail decays at a subexponential rate. Prime examples, like power law distributions
$$
\\bar{F}(x) \\sim \\frac{1}{x^\\alpha}, \\quad \\alpha > 0
$$
